<h3>Angular CLI 6 + Angular 6 + Bootstrap 4 + FontAwesome 5</h3>
<p>This sample shows how to use Angular CLI 6 Libraries.</p>
<p>In this sample we have several components:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A main application</li>
  <li>A store component (library)</li>
  <li>An inventory component (library)</li>
  <li>A number generator component (library)</li>
  <li>A navigation component (library)</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea is that the navigation component is included in all the other components so it allows you to navigate from component to component.</p>

New Java 7 language features that are discussed include switch-on-string and try-with-resources. APIs that are discussed include Threadingthe Collections Frameworkthe Concurrency UtilitiesSwingJava 2DnetworkingJDBCSAXDOMStAXXPathJAX-WSand SAAJ. This book also presents an introduction to Android app development so that you can apply some of its knowledge to the exciting world of Android app development. This book presents the following table of contents:Chapter 1 introduces you to Java and begins to cover the Java language by focusing on fundamental concepts such as commentsidentifiersvariablesexpressionsand statements. Chapter 2 continues to explore this language by presenting all of its features for working with classes and objects. You learn about features related to class declaration and object creationencapsulationinformation hidinginheritancepolymorphisminterfacesand garbage collection. Chapter 3 focuses on the more advanced language features related to nested classespackagesstatic importsexceptionsassertionsannotationsgenericsand enums. Additional chapters introduce you to the few features not covered in Chapters 1 through 3.Chapter 4 largely moves away from covering language features (although it does introduce class literals and strictfp) while focusing on language-oriented APIs. You learn about MathStrictMathPackagePrimitive Type Wrapper ClassesReferenceReflectionStringStringBuffer and StringBuilderThreadingBigDecimaland BigInteger in this chapter. Chapter 5 begins to explore Javas utility APIs by focusing largely on the Collections Framework. Howeverit also discusses legacy collection-oriented APIs and how to create your own collections. Chapter 6 continues to focus on utility APIs by presenting the concurrency utilities along with the Objects and Random classes. Chapter 7 moves you away from the command-line user interfaces that appear in previous chapters and toward graphical user interfaces. You first learn about the Abstract Window Toolkit foundationand then explore the Java Foundation Classes in terms of Swing and Java 2D. Appendix C explores Accessibility and Drag and Drop.Chapter 8 explores filesystem-oriented I/O in terms of the FileRandomAccessFilestreamand writer/reader classes. Chapter 9 introduces you to Javas network APIs (e.g.sockets). It also introduces you to the JDBC API for interacting with databases along with the Java DB database product. Chapter 10 dives into Javas XML support by first presenting an introduction to XML (including DTDs and schemas). It next explores the SAXDOMStAXXPathand XSLT APIs. It even briefly touches on the Validation API. While exploring XPathyou encounter namespace contextsextension functions and function resolversand variables and variable resolvers. Chapter 11 introduces you to Javas support for SOAP-based and RESTful web services. As well as providing you with the basics of these web service categoriesChapter 11 presents some advanced topicssuch as working with the SAAJ API to communicate with a SOAP-based web service without having to rely on JAX-WS. You will appreciate having learned about XML in Chapter 10 before diving into this chapter. Chapter 12 helps you put to use some of the knowledge youve gathered in previous chapters by showing you how to use Java to write an Android apps source code. This chapter introduces you to Androiddiscusses its architectureshows you how to install necessary toolsand develops a simple app. Appendix A presents the solutions to the programming exercises that appear near the end of Chapters 1 through 12. Appendix B introduces you to Javas Scripting API along with Java 7s support for dynamically typed languages. Appendix C introduces you to additional APIs and architecture topics. Examples include AccessibilityclassloadersConsoleDrag and DropJava Native Interfaceand System Tray. Appendix D presents a gallery of significant applications that demonstrate various aspects of Java. Unfortunatelythere are limits to how much knowledge can be crammed into a print book. For this reasonAppendixes ABCand D are not included in this books pages. Insteadthese appendixes are freely distributed as PDF files. Appendixes A and B are bundled with the books associated code file at the Apress website (http://www.apress.com/9781430239093).

It tackles all the fundamentals of analyzing and optimizing performance in clearlogical chapters. OverviewSee how the hardware and the JVM impact performanceLearn which Java features to use with Clojureand howDeep dive into Clojures concurrency and state primitivesDiscover how to design Clojure programs for performanceIn DetailClojure is a youngdynamicfunctional programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine. It is built with performancepragmatismand simplicity in mind. Like most general purpose languagesClojure’s features have different performance characteristics that one should know in order to write high performance code. Clojure High Performance Programming is a practicalto-the-point guide that shows you how to evaluate the performance implications of different Clojure abstractionslearn about their underpinningsand apply the right approach for optimum performance in real-world programs. This book discusses the Clojure language in the light of performance factors that you can exploit in your own code. You will also learn about hardware and JVM internals that also impact Clojure’s performance. Key features include performance vocabularyperformance analysisoptimization techniquesand how to apply these to your programs. You will also find detailed information on Clojures concurrencystate-managementand parallelization primitives. This book is your key to writing high performance Clojure code using the right abstractionin the right placeusing the right technique. What you will learn from this bookLearn techniques for achieving numerical performance in ClojureUse Java features in Clojure code for performanceAvoid reflection and boxing with type hintsAnalyze latency using the Criterium libraryUnderstand Clojures concurrency and state-management primitives in depthExplore how to design Clojure applications for better performanceApproachThis is a shortpractical guide that will teach you everything you need to know to start writing high performance Clojure code. Who this book is written forThis book is ideal for intermediate Clojure developers who are looking to get a good grip on how to achieve optimum performance. You should already have some experience with Clojure and it would help if you already know a little bit of Java. Knowledge of performance analysis and engineering is not required.

Such a publisher would (and we know one who does) use iText for the task. Developers looking to enhance web- and other applications with dynamic PDF document generation and/or manipulation will find this book unique in content and readability. Based on ongoing examples that encourage learning in actionthey will finally understand PDF and learn how to build applications that produce professionalhigh-quality PDF documents. While the basic functionality of iText is easy to acquireiText in Action lowers the learning curve for more advanced functionality. It explains how to use iText to create/manipulate PDF documents on-the-fly in one or more of the following situations: Due to time or sizethe PDF documents cant be produced manuallyThe content of the document must be calculated or based on user input.The content needs to be customized or personalized.The PDF content needs to be served in a web environment.Documents are to be created in batch process mode. All the examples are written in Javabut they can be easily adapted to .NET by developers using one of the .NET ports: iTextSharp (C#) or iText.NET (#J). While iText is a free Java library and the examples are written from the point of view of the Java developernine out of ten examples can be run by .NET developers with only minimal changes.

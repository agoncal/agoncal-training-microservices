### Cleaning Docker images

If you need to clean all the Docker images, use the following commands:

* `docker image ls |Â grep bookstore`
* `/bin/bash -c 'docker image rm $(docker image ls -q "bookstore/*") -f'`


## Infrastructure

The microservice architecture needs a few tools running before it gets to work.

### Consul

Consul is used to register and discover all the microservices

```
$ docker-compose -f consul/consul.yml up
```

Then go to the web interface at http://localhost:8500
